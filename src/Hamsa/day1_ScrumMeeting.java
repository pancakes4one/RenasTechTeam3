What is the difference between STLC and SDLC?
	❖  STLC is part of SDLC.
	❖  STLC is limited to the testing phase to ensure the quality of software product. SDLC is for the complete development of a software product.
	❖  STLC is a very important phase of SDLC and the final product or the software cannot be released without passing through the STLC process.
	❖  STLC is also a part of the post-release/ update cycle, the maintenance phase of SDLC where known defects get fixed or a new functionality is added to the software.  


What are primitives and wrapper classes?implicit and explicit casting?
Primitive: it is simply just a container to keep/store data.Boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short.
Wrapper class: Every primitive has a wrapper class. A wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data type.
When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field we can store primitive data types.
In other words we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.
Java type casting is classified into to types
Winding Casting(Implicit)-Automatic Type Conversion
Narrowing Casting(Explicit)-Need Explicit Conversion


Autoboxing and Unboxing
Autoboxing :Automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.
For example-conversion of int to Interger, long to Long, double to Double etc.
Unboxing: It is just the reverse process of autoboxing . Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing .
For example - conversion of Integer to int, Long to long , Double to double.
